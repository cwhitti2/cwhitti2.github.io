			<tr>
				<td><strong>Synopsis</strong></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Eighth-grader Shigeo "Mob" Kageyama has tapped into his inner wellspring of psychic prowess at a young age. But the power 
				quickly proves to be a liability when he realizes the potential danger in his skills. Choosing to suppress his power, Mob's 
				only present use for his ability is to impress his longtime crush, Tsubomi, who soon grows bored of the same tricks. In order 
				to effectuate control on his skills, Mob enlists himself under the wing of Arataka Reigen, a con artist claiming to be a psychic, 
				who exploits Mob's powers for pocket change. Now, exorcising evil spirits on command has become a part of Mob's daily, monotonous 
				life. However, the psychic energy he exerts is barely the tip of the iceberg; if his vast potential and unrestrained emotions 
				run berserk, a cataclysmic event that would render him completely unrecognizable will be triggered. The progression toward Mob's 
				explosion is rising and attempting to stop it is futile. [Written by MAL Rewrite]</td>

			<th>#4 Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon</th>
		</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><strong>Synopsis</strong></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>As Kobayashi sets off for another day at work, she opens her apartment door only to be met by an unusually frightening 
				sight—the head of a dragon, staring at her from across the balcony. The dragon immediately transforms into a cute, busty, and 
				energetic young girl dressed in a maid outfit, introducing herself as Tooru. It turns out that the stoic programmer had come 
				across the dragon the previous night on a drunken excursion to the mountains, and since the mythical beast had nowhere else 
				to go, she had offered the creature a place to stay in her home. Thus, Tooru had arrived to cash in on the offer, ready to 
				repay her savior's kindness by working as her personal maidservant. Though deeply regretful of her words and hesitant to 
				follow through on her promise, a mix of guilt and Tooru's incredible dragon abilities convinces Kobayashi to take the girl in. 
				Despite being extremely efficient at her job, the maid's unorthodox methods of housekeeping often end up horrifying Kobayashi 
				and at times bring more trouble than help. Furthermore, the circumstances behind the dragon's arrival on Earth seem to be much 
				more complicated than at first glance, as Tooru bears some heavy emotions and painful memories. To top it all off, Tooru's 
				presence ends up attracting several other mythical beings to her new home, bringing in a host of eccentric personalities. 
				Although Kobayashi makes her best effort to handle the crazy situation that she has found herself in, nothing has prepared 
				her for this new life with a dragon maid. [Written by MAL Rewrite]</td>

			<tr>
				<td>Having slept through all four of her alarms, the energetic Narumi Momose finds herself running late for her first day of work 
				at a new office. As she races to catch her train, she makes a promise to herself that none of her coworkers will find out about her 
				dark secret: that she is an otaku and a fujoshi. Her plan goes instantly awry, though, when she runs into Hirotaka Nifuji, an old 
				friend from middle school. Although she tries to keep her secret by inviting him out for drinks after work, her cover is blown 
				when he casually asks her whether or not she will be attending the upcoming Summer Comiket. Luckily for her, the only 
				witnesses—Hanako Koyanagi and Tarou Kabakura—are otaku as well. Later that night, the pair go out for drinks so that they can 
				catch up after all the years apart. After Narumi complains about her previous boyfriend breaking up with her because he refused 
				to date a fujoshi, Hirotaka suggests that she try dating a fellow otaku, specifically himself. He makes a solemn promise to 
				always be there for her, to support her, and to help her farm for rare drops in Monster Hunter. Blown away by the proposal, 
				Narumi agrees immediately. Thus the two otaku start dating, and their adorably awkward romance begins. [Written by MAL Rewrite]</td>

				<td>Sophisticated, suave, sublime; all words which describe the exceedingly handsome and patently perfect Sakamoto. Though it is 
				only his first day in high school, his attractiveness, intelligence, and charm already has the girls swooning and the guys fuming 
				with jealousy. No one seems able to derail him, as all attempts at tripping him up are quickly foiled. His sangfroid is indomitable, 
				his wits peerless. Will any of Sakamoto's classmates, or even teachers, be able to reach his level of excellence? Probably not, but 
				they just might learn a thing or two trying... [Written by MAL Rewrite]</td>

			<tr>
				<td>Onizuka is a reformed biker gang leader who has his sights set on an honorable new ambition: to become the world's greatest 
				teacher... for the purpose of meeting sexy high school girls. Okay, so he's mostly reformed. However, strict administrators and a 
				class of ruthless delinquents stand between Onizuka and his goal and they will use any means, however illegal or low, to drive 
				the new teacher away. Perfect, because Onizuka's methods won't be found in any teaching manual; he cares about the difference 
				between legal and illegal activities about as much as he cares for the age difference between himself and a high school girl. 
				So get ready for math that doesn't add up, language you'd be slapped for using, and biology that would make a grown man blush... 
				unless of course, you're the Great Teacher Onizuka. [Written by MAL Rewrite]</td>
