			<tr>
				<td>When abandoned kittens and his good conscience force second year Sorata Kanda to move into Suimei High School’s infamous 
				Sakura Hall, the satellite dorm and its eccentric, misfit residents turn his life upside down. The decidedly average Sorata 
				finds it difficult to fit in with the bizarre collection of dorm residents like Misaki, an energetic animator; Jin, a playwright 
				playboy; Ryuunosuke, a reclusive programmer; and Chihiro, the dorm manager, art teacher, and party girl. Sorata's friend Nanami, 
				a second year student and aspiring voice actress, pushes him to find new owners for the many cats so that he can quickly move 
				back into the regular dorms. However, his desire to escape Sakura Hall wavers when the pet-like and infantile second year Mashiro 
				Shiina, a world-class artistic savant looking to become a mangaka, transfers in during the spring trimester and quickly latches 
				onto him. Supported by each other's quirks, Sorata and Mashiro come out of their shells and trigger change in the lives of those 
				around them. Based on the light novel series of the same name, Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo explores the fine threads connecting 
				talent, hard work, romance, and friendship with its ensemble cast. [Written by MAL Rewrite]</td>

				who is anything but a cute and fragile girl. Equipped with a wooden katana and feisty personality, Taiga is known throughout 
				the school as the "Palmtop Tiger." One day, an embarrassing mistake causes the two students to cross paths. Ryuuji discovers 
				that Taiga actually has a sweet side: she has a crush on the popular vice president, Yuusaku Kitamura, who happens to be his 
				best friend. But things only get crazier when Ryuuji reveals that he has a crush on Minori Kushieda—Taiga's best friend! 
				Toradora! is a romantic comedy that follows this odd duo as they embark on a quest to help each other with their respective

			<tr>
				<td>Everybody has had that stage in their life where they have thought themselves to be special, different from the masses of 
				ordinary humans. They might go as far as seeing themselves capable of wielding mystical powers, or maybe even believe themselves 
				to have descended from a fantasy realm. This "disease" is known as "chuunibyou" and is often the source of some of the most 
				embarrassing moments of a person's life. For Yuuta Togashi, the scars that his chuunibyou has left behind are still fresh. 
				Having posed as the "Dark Flame Master" during his middle school years, he looks back at those times with extreme embarrassment, 
				so much so that he decides to attend a high school far away where nobody will recognize him. Putting his dark history behind 
				him, he longs to live a normal high school life. Unfortunately, he hasn't escaped his past yet: enter Rikka Takanashi, Yuuta's 
				new classmate and self-declared vessel of the "Wicked Eye." As this eccentric young girl crashes into Yuuta's life, his dream 
				of an ordinary, chuunibyou-free life quickly crumbles away. In this hilarious and heartwarming story of a boy who just wants to 
				leave his embarrassing memories behind, the delusions of old are far from a thing of the past. [Written by MAL Rewrite]</td>

				<td>Music accompanies the path of the human metronome, the prodigious pianist Kousei Arima. But after the passing of his mother, 
				Saki Arima, Kousei falls into a downward spiral, rendering him unable to hear the sound of his own piano. Two years later, Kousei 
				still avoids the piano, leaving behind his admirers and rivals, and lives a colorless life alongside his friends Tsubaki Sawabe 
				and Ryouta Watari. However, everything changes when he meets a beautiful violinist, Kaori Miyazono, who stirs up his world and 
				sets him on a journey to face music again. Based on the manga series of the same name, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso approaches the 
				story of Kousei's recovery as he discovers that music is more than playing each note perfectly, and a single melody can bring 
				in the fresh spring air of April. [Written by MAL Rewrite]</td>

				that aims to extend a helping hand to any student who seeks their support in achieving their goals. With the only other club member 
				being the beautiful ice queen Yukino Yukinoshita, Hachiman finds himself on the front line of other people's problems—a place

				view of society prove to be a hindrance or a tool he can use to his advantage? [Written by MAL Rewrite]</td>
