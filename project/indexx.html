    <h1>My Addiction</h1>
	
	<p>
	 This website is dedicated to my addiction of anime. Anime is a japanese animated cartoon and the source material
	 is usually either manga (comic) or a light novel. 
	 I started watching anime when i was around seventeen years old, I met a group of friends at my workplace
	 and they showed me my very first anime "<a href = "https://myanimelist.net/anime/205/Samurai_Champloo" target="_blank">Samurai Champloo</a>."</p>
	
	<br />
	
	<p>Ever since then I've explored many different storylines and adventures and I gradually became quite the otaku, which is
	 the japanese word for nerd or geek. Thus, I have named this site "Impromptu Otaku" because I never really planned on becoming so fascinated
	 by the stories I read or watch, but I'm happy I have.</p>
